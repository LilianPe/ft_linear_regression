# 📈 ft_linear_regression

**ft_linear_regression** is an introductory **Machine Learning project** developed at **42 School**.  
The goal is to implement a simple **linear regression algorithm**, without using any ML libraries, in order to **predict the price of a car based on its mileage** 🛻.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- 🧠 Understand how linear regression works.
- 📊 Implement the gradient descent algorithm.
- 🔧 Normalize data for better training efficiency.
- 💾 Save and reuse the model parameters.
- 🎯 Predict car prices based on mileage input.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib  

---

## 🌐 Features

- Trains a linear model using a `.csv` dataset 📄  
- Animated visualization of the regression line during training 📈  
- Predicts car price from mileage 🔮  
- Saves learned parameters into a `.json` file 💾

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1. Initialize the model values 🛠️:

```bash
make
```
or
```bash
make re
```
to reset it

### 2. Train the model 🤖:
```bash
python3 ft_linear_regression.py
```

### 3. Make a prediction 🔮:
You can now run
```bash
python3 estimatePrice.py
```
Then enter the mileage you want, then it will prompt the price predicted for it 🎯!
